I am pleased to announce that Jisoo Kim has joined the SNSec Lab. Jisoo is an undergraduate student from the Department of Software, majoring in Data Science at Sookmyung Women's University.

Jisoo's research interests include anomaly detection, AI-driven security, and data mining. She is currently active as the Web Hacking Academic Director and a member of **SISS**---Sookmyung Information Security Study---which she has been a part of since 2023.

I am excited to have Jisoo join our lab and look forward to her contributions.
